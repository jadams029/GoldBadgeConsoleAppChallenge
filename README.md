# GoldBadgeConsoleAppChallenge
The commit changes listed on Github arent 100% accurate due to having issues with setting up the repository on Github.
Any time that I created the repo on there with a readme file attached I ran into a master/main brach issue that eventually got fixed put created an issue at start. 

First actual commit should have been Gettin Challenge on Classes and Repo set up.
Second commit was getting the Unit Tests set up and finished.
Third Commit was getting the program and programUI set up and working. 
Fourth Commit was starting Challenge Two and getting the classes and Repos set up for that. 

This is where the commits are going to get wonky and show up on github

First (bottom) commit on github would be adding .gitignore and .gitattributes to the github repo
Second commit was adding the project files to Github itself. (this is where all of the above work was done)
Third commit was adding the README.md file (this is getting typed out at the end if you couldn't tell)
Fourth commit was getting nearly done with Challenge Two. This involved getting the Program and ProgramUI set up. Did not have the program working as needed yet but was close. Had a couple things that I needed help with to figure out. 
Fifth commit was merging the bracnch 'master' for github which Terry Brown helped me with and got everything alinged on github so I could finish the project. 
Sixth commit was starting Challenge Three and getting classes and repo started along with starting the UnitTests. Wanted to get started on this because I knew that I wasn't going to figure out the problems on Challenge two without help as the issue was using the "Queue" function that Terry showed me and was still working on figuring out. 
Seventh Commit was finishing Challenge Two. The tag on the challenge should be self explanitary, but in case it isn't I have come to figure out that I seem to always look at the larger picture of a project and how it should over all work as opposed to getting just what is asked for down. Need to work on breaking down prompts a bit more and not stress as much about things. 
Eighth Commit was getting the classes and repos set up how they actually needed to and figuring out how dicitonaries actually work. Terry had to help me a lot on this and show me how Dictionaries worked because I'm still having trouble Googling things and understanding how the things I find through there work. 
Ninth commit was the Final product and the project being done and functional. Would not have gotten this done without Terry's help. 
Tenth commmit was going back to something I wanted to fix on the first challenge and change. 
Eleventh Commit was testing to see if I could type out the README in VS Code as opposed to the github website and get it pushed to github through there. It worked which made it much easier to get everything typed out and allows for changed to made easier to the README if needed. 
Twelth Commit will be pushing the "Finished README" to github and any commits after will be working changes to the project or formatting the README.
